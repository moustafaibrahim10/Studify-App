1. Project Description

Studify is a comprehensive productivity and study management app designed to help students organize their academic life efficiently. It combines multiple essential tools such as (task management, Pomodoro sessions, flashcards, and progress tracking) into one intuitive platform.

The app allows users to set study goals, monitor their daily and weekly performance, manage tasks by subject, and review study materials using interactive flashcards.

As a team of students, we understand the everyday challenges of managing time, staying focused, and keeping up with academic responsibilities. Through Studify, we aim to help ourselves and other students improve productivity, maintain motivation, and make learning more engaging and structured.

2. Objectives

Develop an intuitive Android application that integrates task management, a Pomodoro timer, and a flashcard study system in one platform.

Enable students to track their progress and visualize their study patterns through interactive analytics and charts.

Improve students’ time management and study consistency using personalized reminders and performance insights.

(Internal Team Goal) Encourage collaboration, learning, and mutual support within our team as we apply our skills and learn from each other during development.
